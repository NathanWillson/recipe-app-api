66. Write tests for create user API [Follow Along]

create tests for our create user endpoint


So we're going to be breaking down all tests into public and private different tests.
I'm going to explain what I mean in a minute.
Public is basically unauthenticated requests, so requests that don't require authentication.
And that's things such as registering a new user because obviously to register a new user, you can't
have authentication because the user is not registered.
If they were registered, they would need to register new user.
So we break down our tests into ones that don't require authentication and later on will be added,
some that do require authentication.



status.HTTP_201_CREATED
That's the success response code for creating objects in the database via an API.

(**payload) means email = email and password = password

HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST means email id already exists in database
user_exists is used to check if user email is not saved in data base as password is too short
